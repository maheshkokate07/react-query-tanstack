Day 9 - Prefetching & Initial Data

- Prefetching – fetch data in the background before the user needs it (hover/click).
- Instant UI – cached data appears immediately without showing spinners.
- Initial Data – placeholder data displays instantly, then updates with real results.
- Better UX – no empty states; smoother transitions between actions.
- Practical use cases – hover menus, tooltips, anticipating navigation.
- Cache smartness – React Query reuses prefetched data across components.
