Day 8 - Parallel Queries

- Multiple queries fetch simultaneously – no waiting for one to finish before starting another.
- Independent queries – failure in one does not block others.
- Cached results – switching between categories or views feels instant.
- Faster UI – avoids unnecessary delays, users see data as soon as it’s ready.
- Real-world use – dashboards, feeds, product pages where multiple datasets are shown together.
- Open the Network tab to watch parallel requests firing at once.
