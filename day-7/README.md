Day 7 - Invalidation & Auto Refetching

- Query invalidation – UI stays in sync automatically after mutations.
- Manual refresh button – instantly re-fetch the latest todos on demand.
- Auto-refetch every 10s – keeps data fresh like a live feed.
- Stale/Cache control – React Query decides when to fetch vs reuse cached data.
- Optimized user experience – always up-to-date data without spamming requests.
- Open the Network tab to see background polling and refetches in action.
