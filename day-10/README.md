Day 10 - Suspense & Error Boundaries

- Suspense mode* – declarative loading UI with 'React.Suspense' fallback.  
- Error Boundaries + Reset – catch real API errors and retry gracefully.  
- Consistent UX – same spinner and error UI across the app.  
- No manual state checks – focus only on rendering, React Query handles loading/error.  
- Dropdown control – switch between Normal, Loading (Suspense), and Error (Fallback) modes to test behaviors.  
- Inspect network tab – see real requests, delays, and failures in action.  
- Practical use cases – dashboards, profile screens, or any page with frequent fetch failures.
